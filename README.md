#### _Convert a number into the Roman Numeral version, June 8th, 2017_

#### By _**Joe Kramer**_

## Description

_This tool will take any number between 1-3999 and convert it into the Roman Numeral version. 3999 is the largest number that can be represented by Roman numerals by their standard rules_

## Specifications

* _Add value of all symbols_
* _Exception to first rule: there may not be more than three of the same characters in a row. Instead, you switch to subtraction._
* _Example of above exception: So instead of writing IIII for 4, you write IV (for 5 minus 1); and instead of writing LXXXX for 90, you write XC._
* _You have to separate ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands. In other words, 99 is XCIX, not IC._
* _You cannot count higher than 3,999 in Roman numerals._
